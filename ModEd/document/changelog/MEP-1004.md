module: hr

## Description

Create model, controller, CLI, and other necessary utilities to manage human resources related information.

- Student [1:1]  
  Each student has a single record determining whether they are:
  - Regular Student

The implemented module must be able to import data from CSV and JSON files and dumped
into SQLite database and list the data from DB. Note that database vendor should be able
