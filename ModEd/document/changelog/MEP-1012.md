# MEP-1012 Asset

module: asset

## Description
Develop a model, controller, CLI, and other necessary utilities to manage assets within the ModEd system.

## 1. Warehouse System
The system should support the following asset management operations:

### 1.1 Asset Categories
- Create and manage categories for assets.

### 1.2 Asset and Inventory Management
- Add new assets (equipment, measurement instrument, IT devices, etc.) to the system.
- Add consumable supplies (e.g., stationery, electronic components) to the inventory.
- Manage existing assets, including:
    - Assign assets to predefined categories.
    - Edit asset details (e.g., name, description, purchase date, vendor).
    - Update asset statuses (e.g., available, under maintenance, salvage).
    - Decommission or savage of outdated or unusable assets.

### 1.3 Borrowing & Checkout System
- Allow users to request, borrow, and return items from the warehouse.
- Differentiate between:
    - Consumables (supplies that are used up and not returned).
    - Movable assets (e.g., laptops, projectors, lab equipment that can be temporarily assigned).
    - Fixed assets (e.g., table, large machinery, permanently assigned assets).

## 2. Asset Logging System
- Track all actions performed within the system, including:
    - Asset/Supply additions and updates.
    - Asset decommissioning or disposal.
    - Asset borrowing and returning.
    - Inventory withdrawals.
- Provide detailed logs for audit and reporting purposes.

## 3. User Access Control
Define different levels of access to the system:
- Asset Manager – Can add, edit, salvage, and categorize assets.
- Warehouse Staff – Can process asset checkouts, returns, and stock management.
- Borrower – Can request and borrow assets.
