## Description

and related data:

- Curriculum

- Class, which map Course to Instructor, Section, and Student
    - Type of class should be separated between obligated and optional

The implemented module must be able to import data from CSV and JSON files and dumped
into SQLite database and list the data from DB. Note that database vendor should be able
to choose later using GORM. Models can be added according to the requirements of other
modules.
