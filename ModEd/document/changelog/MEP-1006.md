The implemented module must be able to import data from CSV and JSON files and dumped into SQLite database and list the data from DB. Note that database vendor should be able to choose later using GORM. Models can be added according to the requirements of other modules.

The relation between models (1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-N) must be considered.
