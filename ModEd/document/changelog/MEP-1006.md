# MEP-1006 Quiz and Assignment

module: eval

## Description
Create model, controller, CLI, and other necessary utilities to manage basic master data for ModEd:
- Evaluation Model
    - Allow instructors to evaluate student score.
- Track Progress
    - Track student's assignment progress.
- Quiz
    - Allow students to take a quiz.
- Assignment
    - Allow students to send their assignment.

The implemented module must be able to import data from CSV and JSON files and dumped into SQLite database and list the data from DB. Note that database vendor should be able to choose later using GORM. Models can be added according to the requirements of other modules.

The relation between models (1-to-1, 1-to-N, N-to-N) must be considered.
