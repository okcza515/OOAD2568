## MEP-1013

###- Progess
    - Use Base controller
    - Use core handler strategy
    - Space management handler strategy (other than in core)
    - Create interface of method in each controller

###- Design Pattern
    - Strategy
        - Use in the handler for encapsulate without changing client code.
    - State
        - In menu state to link to handler function.
    - Singleton
        - In each controller
    - Command
        - Use in ToString() method function for generate great UI.
    - Facade (Not sure)
